## Hi!

I’m **Étienne**, an **audio and embedded systems engineer** passionate about blending sound and technology.

With a background in Acoustics, Signal Processing applied to music, and embedded systems, I’ve worked on stuff ranging from automotive audio optimization to DJ mix transcription at IRCAM. I’m always excited to innovate where technology and sound meet.

**I am currently looking for work and/or PhD opportunities in audio, signal processing and embedded systems.**

Feel free to explore my [resume](/resume) and [publications](/publications), and stay tuned for upcoming technical [blog posts](/posts) where I’ll dive into my projects and share insights!
