## Hi!

<img src="/me.jpg" class="profile-picture" alt="Profile picture of Étienne Paul André">

I’m **Étienne**, an **audio and embedded systems engineer** passionate about blending sound and technology, based in Paris, France.

With a background in acoustics, signal processing and machine learning applied to music, and embedded systems, I’ve worked on stuff ranging from automotive audio optimization to DJ mix transcription at IRCAM. I’m always excited to innovate where technology and sound meet.

Feel free to explore my [resume](/resume) and [publications](/publications), and stay tuned for upcoming [blog posts](/posts) where I’ll dive into my projects and share insights!
